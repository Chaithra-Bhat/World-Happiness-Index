The study of the happiness index of various countries continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.

The inspiration behind the analysis of this case study are questions such as - What countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness? Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness?

* The independent variables are the factors that affect people’s happiness such as family, freedom, life expectancy, GDP per capita, generosity, and trust in government corruption.

The countries are Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and Australia.
